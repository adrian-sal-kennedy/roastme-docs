# Roastme!

A social cookbook. Perhaps a social library of social cookbooks.

Users can create a recipe using an intuitive tool set, refine it as it evolves, and ultimately publish and share it in an attractive blog format designed for sharing on your favourite social media platforms.

The ultimate goal is a sort of github for recipes. Each recipe maintains a complete history of every change made, and which user made that change. Users can "fork üç¥" a recipe and it becomes theirs, free to modify as they please.

## Purpose

Cuisine is arguably the only thing all the myriad cultures and creeds in this world can agree on and bond over.

Recipes have deep roots in culture, as reflected in the huge swaths of text one finds when they look up any recipe ("skip to ingredients" please).

Probably because of this, the best dishes don't have well-defined recipes with uniform or even repeatable measures for what needs to go on or in them. Many include whimsical measures like drams, handfuls or cups.

Initially Roastme will simply define recipes in text, however under the hood there will be room to get all of this into grams, taking into account the densities of different ingredients that would otherwise be measured by volume.
